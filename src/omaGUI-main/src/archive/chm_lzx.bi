    Project: omaGUI CHM Reader
    -------------------------

    File: chm_lzx.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare the bounded LZX decompressor used by CHM archive reads.

    Responsibilities:

        - expose one reset-interval decompression operation
        - keep codec state private to the archive implementation

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the chm_lzx component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - CHM directory or file lookup
        - temporary-file or platform codec APIs
        - a public end-user compression API

    The decoder follows the LZX format and the FreeBASIC port is based on
    the LGPL-2.1-or-later libmspack implementation. See LICENSES/LGPL-2.1.txt.
