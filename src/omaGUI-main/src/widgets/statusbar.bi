    File: statusbar.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare a portable Windows-style status bar with bounded panels.

    Responsibilities:

        - retain fixed-width and flexible text panels
        - expose checked panel construction, text updates, and alignment
        - provide a noninteractive widget lifecycle

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the statusbar component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - application status policy
        - pointer or keyboard input
        - platform-native status-bar declarations
