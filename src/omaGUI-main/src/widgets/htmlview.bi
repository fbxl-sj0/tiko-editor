    File: htmlview.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare a small, portable HTML document viewer widget.

    Responsibilities:

        - expose a BASIC-shaped API for HTML text and file loading
        - expose cooperative single-threaded document loading
        - retain bounded layout, scrolling, title, anchor, and link state
        - retain bounded rules from linked local stylesheets
        - expose link activation through polling or an optional callback
        - expose an optional application image provider with clear ownership

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the htmlview component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - networking, URL fetching, or shell launching
        - JavaScript, executable CSS, or browser-engine integration
        - platform-specific web controls

        Cooperative loader ownership

        loadContext is an opaque implementation-owned staging document.  The
        active item list remains renderable until that context completes and
        transfers ownership atomically on the GUI thread.

    Link callback signature

    A handler passed to htmlview_SetLinkHandler must have this shape:

        Sub Handler( _
            ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr, _
            ByVal href As String, _
            ByVal context As Any Ptr _
        )

    The viewer never opens the link itself. This keeps navigation policy,
    network access, and external program launching under application control.
'/

Declare Function htmlview_Create( _
    ByVal nm As String, _
    ByVal x As Integer, ByVal y As Integer, _

    Image callback signature

    An image handler provides application-owned schemes such as "dd:image:0":

        Function Handler( _
            ByVal source As String, _
            ByVal context As Any Ptr, _
            ByRef loadedImage As RasterImage Ptr, _
            ByRef errorMessage As String _
        ) As Integer

    On success, ownership of loadedImage transfers to the viewer. Returning
    zero leaves ordinary relative and absolute local-file loading available.
'/
Declare Sub htmlview_SetImageHandler( _
    ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr, _
    ByVal handler As Any Ptr, _
    ByVal context As Any Ptr = 0 _
)

/'
    Resource callback signature

    A handler passed to htmlview_SetResourceHandler can provide linked
    stylesheets or other small text resources from an application-owned
    namespace such as "chm://style.css". Returning zero allows ordinary
    local-file loading only when the resolved path is not a URI scheme.
'/
Declare Sub htmlview_SetResourceHandler( _
    ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr, _
    ByVal handler As Any Ptr, _
    ByVal context As Any Ptr = 0 _

Declare Function htmlview_GetPlainText(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr) As String
Declare Function htmlview_GetLastError(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr) As String
Declare Function htmlview_GetBasePath(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr) As String
Declare Function htmlview_GetContentHeight(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr) As Integer
Declare Function htmlview_GetScroll(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr) As Integer
Declare Sub htmlview_SetScroll(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr, ByVal pixelOffset As Integer)
Declare Function htmlview_GotoAnchor( _
    ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr, ByVal anchorName As String _
) As Integer
Declare Function htmlview_PopLink( _
    ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr, ByRef href As String _
) As Integer

Declare Sub htmlview_Render(ByVal htmlWidget As Widget Ptr)
