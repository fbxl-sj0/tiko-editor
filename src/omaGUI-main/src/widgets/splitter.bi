    Project: omaGUI
    File: splitter.bi
    Purpose: Declare a movable divider for application panes.
    Responsibilities:
        - expose bounded parent-relative positions and input notifications
        - retain one pointer drag and a borrowed GUI-thread callback
    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the splitter component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:
        - pane ownership, application layout policy, or platform declarations
