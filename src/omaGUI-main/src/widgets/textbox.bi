    Project: omaGUI
    ---------------

    File: textbox.bi

    Targets: FreeBASIC fb dialect; the including application selects the native backend.
    Module API: omaGUI declarations and implementation for textbox.

    Purpose:

        Declare the reusable editable text widget used by editor popups and
        ordinary single-line controls.

    Responsibilities:

        - define textbox state owned by each widget
        - expose textbox construction and update/render entry points
        - retain bounded per-widget text undo and redo state
        - retain mouse-drag and keyboard selection state
        - expose configurable multiline vertical scrollbar behavior
        - optionally insert spaces at tab stops in multiline editors
        - expose atomic logical-line indentation with retained selections
        - expose an optional fixed line-number gutter for multiline editors
        - expose focusable read-only and public editor-command state
        - expose an optional byte limit for native editing commands
        - retain optional caller-supplied client and text colors
        - optionally style embedded glyphs without changing editor metrics
        - support single-line masked display without replacing editor text
        - expose optional synchronous KeyDown, KeyPress, and KeyUp callbacks
        - retain optional syntax-highlighting mode and semantic color metadata
          for keywords, types, objects, members, procedures, and literals

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - clipboard implementation
        - keyboard polling
        - application-specific text validation

    Optional lexer checkpoint for unwrapped viewports. The application owns
