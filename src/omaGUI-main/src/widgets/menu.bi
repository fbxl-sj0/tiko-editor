    Project: omaGUI
    ---------------

    File: menu.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare a bounded popup menu used directly and by imported dropdowns.

    Responsibilities:

        - retain menu labels, hover selection, and callbacks
        - support item separators and per-item callbacks
        - own nested popup trees with mouse and keyboard navigation
        - support per-item visibility, checked state, and keyboard shortcuts
        - support configurable item height and one context-aware handler
        - retain shared insets for drawing, placement, and pointer rows
        - expose item reset for reusable generated popups

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the menu component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - application command policy
        - imported-control ownership rules
        - global pointer-routing policy

        Pointer activation is latched at press and published once on a

        the item callback on every GUI frame and can walk through generated
        menus before the user can react.

    Display-text insertion stores a caption exactly as supplied. Applications
    that already translated it use this path to avoid translating a result
    again, which can select a different catalog phrase. Ordinary insertion
    continues to apply the GUI text transform once. All calls own copies of
    caption bytes and run on the GUI thread, including inside update scopes.

    Attaching transfers submenu lifetime to the parent widget tree. Add the
