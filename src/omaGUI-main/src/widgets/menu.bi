    File: menu.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare a bounded popup menu used directly and by imported dropdowns.

    Responsibilities:

        - retain menu labels, hover selection, and callbacks
        - support per-item callbacks or one context-aware selection handler
        - expose item reset for reusable generated popups

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - application command policy
        - imported-control ownership rules
        - global pointer-routing policy
