    Purpose: Keep unchanged scene pixels and collect bounded repaint regions.
    Responsibilities: Observe GUI-thread visual keys, retain old widget bounds,
        merge overlapping damage and recover from layout or registry changes.
    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Implementation unit assembled by omaGUI.bi when OMAGUI_IMPLEMENTATION is defined.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain: input dispatch, widget drawing or page switching.
'/

' This implementation is included by widgets.bas and shares its registry.
' Keys are observations, not hashes: equality cannot hide a hash collision.
' An observer must be read-only and must not alter the widget registry.
