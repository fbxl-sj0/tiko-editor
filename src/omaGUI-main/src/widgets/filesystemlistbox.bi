    File: filesystemlistbox.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare portable factories for the classic directory, drive, and file
        list controls used by VBDOS forms.

    Responsibilities:

        - create ordinary omaGUI list boxes populated from host paths
        - refresh directory names, file-pattern matches, or available roots
        - report why a transactional refresh could not be completed
        - retain deterministic case-insensitive entry ordering
        - match file patterns consistently across host filesystems
        - preserve the old list when a path, pattern, or capacity check fails
        - combine explicit semicolon-separated patterns without duplicate rows

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the filesystemlistbox component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - platform SDK declarations
