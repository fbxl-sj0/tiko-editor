    File: picturebox.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare a framed display surface compatible with classic PictureBox
        controls.

    Responsibilities:

        - retain optional display text
        - own a copied raster image beneath retained drawings and text
        - own separate, lazily allocated byte-cell and pixel drawing surfaces
        - retain optional caller-supplied client and text colors
        - expose flat, single-line, and sunken border styles
        - provide a clipped client area for child widgets

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the picturebox component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - bitmap decoding or drawing algorithms
        - application-specific drawing callbacks
        - pointer or keyboard behavior
