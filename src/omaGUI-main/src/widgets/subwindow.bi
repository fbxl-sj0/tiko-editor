    File: subwindow.bi

    Purpose:
        Declare movable, resizable, ordered, closable child windows.

    Responsibilities:
        - expose subwindow construction and lifecycle operations
        - retain pointer-captured move, resize, and close-button state
        - expose an optional application close callback
        - expose checked title replacement and retrieval
        - retain an optional client-area color
        - retain a title palette independently of menu/selection colors
        - retain portable none, single, sizable-single, and double borders
        - retain normal geometry across minimized and maximized states
        - expose portable control-box, minimize, and maximize title controls

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the subwindow component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:
        - window ordering policy
        - child rendering or input clipping policy
        - platform-native window management
