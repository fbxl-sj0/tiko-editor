    File: backend.bi

    Purpose:
        Declare the gfxlib graphics, text, clipping, and window interface.

    Responsibilities:
        - configure fixed or resizable platform windows
        - configure true-color and balanced indexed-color display modes
        - report the live drawable area after a window resize
        - expose primitive and alpha-aware drawing operations
        - expose embedded-font measurement and rendering operations

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:
        - widget-specific behavior
        - input polling
        - application-specific layout rules
