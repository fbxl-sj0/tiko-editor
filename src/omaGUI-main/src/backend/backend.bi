    Project: omaGUI
    ---------------
    File: backend.bi

    Purpose:
        Declare the gfxlib graphics, text, clipping, and window interface.

    Responsibilities:
        - configure fixed or resizable platform windows
        - configure true-color and balanced indexed-color display modes
        - report the live drawable area after a window resize
        - expose primitive and alpha-aware drawing operations
        - expose embedded-font measurement and rendering operations
        - load complete Unicode glyph packs for UTF-8 text
        - expose bitmap italic rendering without changing glyph advance

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the backend component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:
        - widget-specific behavior
        - input polling
        - application-specific layout rules

    Load a sorted OGF1 bitmap font pack into a backend-owned font slot.
    Default, Arial, Cascadia, Terminal, and Unicode fallback slots accept
    packs. For missing non-ASCII glyphs, the CJK pack is searched first and
    the default UI pack supplies mapped marks or symbols it does not contain.
    Its zero-advance mark takes precedence when the selected or CJK face gives
    the same combining codepoint a spacing advance.
    Loading an embedded slot overrides its face until packs are cleared.
    Load UI packs before creating controls so their measurements stay valid.
