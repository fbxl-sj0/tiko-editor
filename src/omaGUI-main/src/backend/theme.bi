    File: theme.bi

    Purpose:

        Declare the shared classic widget color theme.

    Responsibilities:

        - define the color fields consumed by standard widgets
        - expose normal, dark, and black palette selection
        - expose portable classic shadow and three-dimensional effects
        - expose independent classic menu, border, command, and scrollbar colors
        - expose semantic color lookup for standard widgets

    Targets:

        FreeBASIC builds with built-in gfxlib; gfxlib3 is optional when supplied by the compiler.

    Module API:

        Declarations for the theme component in the omaGUI include graph.

    This file intentionally does NOT contain:

        - widget rendering
        - theme persistence or file parsing
        - platform-native appearance discovery
